# AI-Mushroom-Picker-Bot
2D simulator made in Java with Weka 3 and jFuzzyLogic wherein an AI Bot searches for mushrooms in itâ€™s general vicinity.
Once it detects a mushroom it will calculate what the shortest path to it is and will take that path.
The bot is constantly learning how to make every path as short as possible.
When it reaches the mushroom, the bot scans it in order to understand if it is eatable or poisonous.
If the mushroom is poisonous, the bot will destroy it. If the mushroom is eatable, the bot will pick it.
Everytime a mushroom is picked or destroyed, a new one spawns in a random location.
